# NLP Text Processing using TF-IDF

This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for text feature extraction. It shows how raw text data can be converted into numerical features for machine learning models.

## 📌 Objectives

* Perform text preprocessing and cleaning
* Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
* Understand feature extraction techniques in NLP
* Prepare data for machine learning models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK / Text preprocessing tools
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

* Loaded and explored text dataset
* Cleaned and preprocessed text
* Applied tokenization and stopword removal
* Converted text into TF-IDF vectors
* Prepared features for machine learning

## 📊 Result

TF-IDF successfully converts textual data into numerical form, enabling machine learning algorithms to process and analyze text.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
* Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
* Deploy NLP app using Streamlit

## 📎 Use Cases

* Spam detection
* Sentiment analysis
* Document classification
* Search engines
